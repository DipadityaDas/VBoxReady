Hyper-V is not a tool for inexperienced PC users. Itâ€™s a utility, which replaces Microsoft Virtual PC and allows running multiple operating systems on a single device. Hyper-V simplifies the lives of software developers, professional IT workers or tech-savvy people who opt for working or experimenting with multiple OS, including various Linux releases, FreeBSD, and Windows.

Many third-party virtualization applications don't work together with Hyper-V. Affected applications include VMware Workstation and VirtualBox. These applications might not start virtual machines, or they may fall back to a slower, emulated mode.

These symptoms are introduced when the Hyper-V Hypervisor is running. Some security solutions are also dependent on the hypervisor, such as:

- Device Guard
- Credential Guard

## Determine whether the Hyper-V hypervisor is running

To determine whether the Hyper-V hypervisor is running, follow these steps:
1. In the search box, type `msinfo32.exe`.
2. Select System Information.
3. In the detail window, locate the following entry:
> ***`A hypervisor has been detected. Features required for Hyper-V will not be displayed.`***

## Cause
> **This behavior occurs by design.**

Many virtualization applications depend on **hardware virtualization extensions** that are available on most *modern processors*. It includes `Intel VT-x` and `AMD-V`. 

**Only one software component can use this hardware at a time. The hardware cannot be shared between virtualization applications.**

To use other virtualization software, you must disable Hyper-V Hypervisor, Device Guard, and Credential Guard. 

If you want to disable Hyper-V Hypervisor, then you can follow the old method(GUI) ,i.e., to disable with Hyper-V, Device Guard and Credential Guard from [Windows Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/application-management/virtualization-apps-not-work-with-hyper-v)

But I have created another way. Everytime there is a windows update, Microsoft-Hyper-V is enabled automatically, as it is necessary for the installation process of the programs.
