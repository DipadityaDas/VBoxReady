Hyper-V is not a tool for inexperienced PC users. Itâ€™s a utility, which replaces Microsoft Virtual PC and allows running multiple operating systems on a single device. Hyper-V simplifies the lives of software developers, professional IT workers or tech-savvy people who opt for working or experimenting with multiple OS, including various Linux releases, FreeBSD, and Windows.

Many third-party virtualization applications don't work together with Hyper-V. Affected applications include VMware Workstation and VirtualBox.
